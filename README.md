# PA-VA Realty Housing Prices Prediction

● Performed exploratory data analysis and a host of machine learning methods on a historical dataset of
housing prices in Richmond, Virginia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to build a model to accurately predict
housing prices

● Models built from best subset selection, multiple regression, ridge regression, lasso, principle components
analysis, partial least squares, regression tree, pruned regression tree, bagging, boosting, random forest

● Helped identify under/overpriced homes, influential factors in determining house price, and a “best model”
defined by lowest test MSE
